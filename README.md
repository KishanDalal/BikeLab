A demo of regression 
Regression Models for discovering correlating features with the ability to focus on a particular feature is an important aspect covered in many organizations including bike sharing program. The decision for estimating future bike quantity needed depending on the features can provide a basis for procurement or the creation of the product. This project applies several machine learning algorithms to enhance decisions on bike usage. These methods are implemented on a dataset obtained from UCI Learning Repository which are combination of resources from bike data from Capital Bike Share, weather data from Freemeteo, and holiday data from DCHR. The reader should be aware that the data is derived from United States of America therefore should account for possible differences. Results should that employed machine learning methods don't have a high result in predicting accuracy were some excel more than others.
